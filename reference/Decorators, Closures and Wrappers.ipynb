    "\n",
    "When dealing with a large codebase, it’s very common to have a set of tasks that need to be performed by many different functions, usually before or after doing something more specific to the function at hand. The nature of these tasks is as varied as the projects that use them, but here are some of the more common examples of where decorators are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Access control \n",
    "- Cleanup of temporary objects\n",
    "- Error handling\n",
    "- Caching\n",
    "- Logging\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of these cases, there’s some boilerplate code that needs to be executed before or after what the function’s really trying to do. Rather than copying that code into each function, it’d be better if it could be written once and simply applied to each function that needs it. This is where decorators come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, decorators are just simple functions designed with one purpose: *accept a function and return a function*. The function returned can be the same as the one passed in or it could be completely replaced by something else along the way. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most common way to apply a decorator is using a special syntax designed just for this purpose. Here’s how you could apply a decorator designed to suppress any errors during the execution of a function:\n"

By returning the wrapper instead of the original function, we form a **closure**, which allows the same function handle to be used even after `suppress_errors()` is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the `wrapper` has to be called as if it were the original function, regardless of how that function was defined, *it must accept all possible argument combinations*. This is achieved by using *variable positional and keyword arguments* together and passing them straight into the original function internally. This is a very common practice with wrappers because it allows maximum flexibility, without caring what type of function it’s applied to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual work in the wrapper is quite simple: just execute the original function inside a `try/except block` to catch any errors that are raised. In the event of any errors, it just continues merrily along, implicitly returning None instead of doing anything interesting. It also makes sure to return any value returned by the original function, so that everything meaningful about the wrapped function is maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the wrapper function is fairly simple, but the basic idea works for many more complex situations as well. There could be several lines of code both before and after the original function is called, perhaps with some decisions about whether it is called at all. Authorization wrappers, for instance, will typically return or raise an exception without ever calling the wrapped function, if the authorization failed for any reason."
