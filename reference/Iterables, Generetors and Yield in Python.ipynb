    "\n",
    "A problem with lists is that they can easily grow very big. `range(1000000)` creates an actual list of 1 million elements. If you only need to deal with them one at a time, this can be a huge source of inefficiency (or of running out of memory). If you potentially only need the first few values, then calculating them all is a waste.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **generator** is something that you can iterate over (for us, usually using for) but whose values are produced only as needed (lazily).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike normal functions that return a value and exit, **generator functions** automatically suspend and resume their execution and state around the point of value generation. Because of that, they are often a useful alternative to both computing an entire series of values up front and manually saving and restoring state in classes. The state that generator functions retain when they are suspended includes both their code location, and their entire local scope. Hence, their local variables retain information between results, and make it available when the functions are resumed.\n",

When resumed, the function continues execution immediately after the last yield run. From the function’s perspective, this allows its code to produce a series of values over time, rather than computing them all at once and sending them back in something like a list."

    "### Why generators functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators can be better in terms of both memory use and performance in larger programs. They allow functions to avoid doing all the work up front, which is especially useful when the result lists are large or when it takes a lot of computation to produce each value. Generators distribute the time required to produce the series of values among loop iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, for more advanced uses, generators can provide a simpler alternative to manually saving the state between iterations in class objects—with generators, variables accessible in the function’s scopes are saved and restored automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why generator expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like generator functions, generator expressions are a memory-space optimization —they do not require the entire result list to be constructed all at once, as the square- bracketed list comprehension does. Also like generator functions, they divide the work of results production into smaller time slices—they yield results in piecemeal fashion, instead of making the caller wait for the full set to be created in a single call.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, generator expressions may also run slightly slower than list com- prehensions in practice, so they are probably best used only for very large result sets, or applications that cannot wait for full results generation. A more authoritative state- ment about performance, though, will have to await the timing scripts we’ll code in the next chapter."
